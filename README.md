ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute), founded since 1973, is Taiwanâ€™s largest research institutions.

ICL (Information and Communication Laboratories), one of the major Lab in ITRI, wherein research covers information, networking, cloud, fintech, communication, and IC technologies.

DLA (Deep Learning Accelerator), is the flexible DNN processing engine opened by NVDIA, and now has been revised with several features, including the support of MobileNet Series, weight decompression of convolution / fully-connected operations, and various customize options for users.

The first open DLA here is the most basic one, 64-MAC version, which is originally named nv_small in NVDIA's open source. Here we provide the synthesizable codes, and project files for popular Xilinx MPSOC FPGA Series.
